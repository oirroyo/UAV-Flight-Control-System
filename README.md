# UAV-Flight-Control-System

Collaborated on a team project to design and simulate an automatic flight control system for an **Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)**.
The system was capable of guiding the UAV through **climb, level flight, and descent** phases based on user-defined vertical waypoints.

💡 Outcomes & Insights
- Applied control theory to a realistic UAV model 
- Strengthened skills in **Simulink** simulation, automation logic, and systems integration 
- Enhanced understanding of UAV dynamics and real-time control implementation
